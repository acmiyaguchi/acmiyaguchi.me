Toastmasters encourages positive feedback by making speech evaluations an
integral part of the practice. Applying constructive criticism is valuable for
improving speech content and delivery. How else are you supposed to know how an
audience will react to what you say without fielding it in front of a live
audience? In this post, I'll discuss the process of receiving and applying
feedback to a speech.

On {presented_date}, I presented the first rendition of "Making a consistent cup
of coffee" to the Mountain View Toastmasters club. I gave this speech twice as
part of my "Evaluation and Feedback" project, where the objective was to present
a speech on any topic, receive feedback, and apply the feedback to the second
speech. Here is the speech.

During the evaluation section of the meeting, I was given feedback by a fellow
Toastmaster, Steve, on things that I did well and things that I could improve on
in the future. Despite this taking place over a year and a half ago, I clearly
remember learning from his evaluation.

The first was that he noticed that there were oohs and laughing coming from the
audience. I was surprised to hear that the audience enjoyed the speech; I was so
tense that I never noticed the audience's reaction. I've recently been getting
better at gauging the audience, but it doesn't come easy, especially in an
online format.

He also observed my frequent use of the word "sour" to describe coffee. When I
rewatched this recording, "sour" was very apparent. I dug up an old transcript I
made of the speech and found that I used the word 14 times! That's far too
repetitive.

Finally, he challenged me to better incorporate eye contact with the audience to
build rapport and engagement. I made this my primary goal for the next iteration
of the speech. I've always acknowledged this as an area of potential
improvement, so this next speech would be my crucible.

Later that evening, at a club social event at Tied House, I got feedback from
more members. One suggested that it was a bit weird just having the bottom piece
of the AeroPress. Yes, that was probably true. Another told me that they were
waiting in anticipation for a more profound message -- and that I could have
found a better word than "nice" to describe the experience.

With all of this feedback in my hands, I sat on it for a few months. When I came
back to it again, I made some significant changes to the speech.

- I rewrote and memorized my opening and conclusions. It helped me set the pace
  and provided room for a more thoughtful conclusion.
- I made sure to actually bring my AeroPress. I planned to use the demonstration
  to make eye-contact with the entire audience by moving after each step in the
  process.
- I practiced a _lot_ more than I did the first time around. The results speak
  for themselves -- I was at ease and spoke with a better rhythm.

I presented the second rendition to the club on {presented_date2}. You might be

process.

Though only a few months difference, these two speeches feel leagues apart in
terms of quality. The feedback I received had a strong influence on how I
approached the speech the second time around. The practice also smoothed the
delivery. And, though not in my control, the camera angle was a bit better. It's
actually challenging for me to sit through the first rendition of the speech,
but much more comfortable to watch the second one several times over.

I attribute my improvement to great feedback from the entire club and the effort
I invested in learning from previous experiences. I hope this short arc proves
useful to you. If anything, keep recordings and watch yourself move the needle
toward competency. I often feel as if progress is a fleeting goal that can never
be reached. It's motivating to be proven wrong and to watch evidence of my
growth.
