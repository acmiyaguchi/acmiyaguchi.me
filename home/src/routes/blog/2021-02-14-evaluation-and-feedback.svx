Applying constructive criticism is valuable in improving speech content and
delivery. How else are you supposed to know how an audience will react to what
you say without fielding it in front of a live audience? Toastmasters encourages
postive feedback by making speech evaluations an integral part of practice. In
this post, I'll discuss the process of recieving and applying feedback to a
speech.

On {presented_date}, I presented the first rendition of "Making a consistent cup
of coffee" to the Mountain View Toastmasters club. I gave this speech twice as
part of my evaluation and feedback speeches as a Level 1 pathway speech, where
the objective is to present a speech on any topic, receive feedback, and apply
the feedback to the second speech. Here is the speech.

After the speech, I was given some feedback from a fellow Toastmaster, Steve, on
things that I did well and things that I could improve on in the future. Even
though this was now almost a year and a half ago, I clearly remember learning
new things from his perspective on the speech. The first was that he noticed
that there were oohs and laughing coming from the audience. I was so tensed up
and nervous that I never even noticed the reaction that was coming from the
audience. He also mentioned that I repeated the word sour frequently throughout
the speech. I noticed this after watching through my recording. I use the word
sour 14 times. One salient point that he made was that my eye contact was
missing from a large portion of the speech.

Later that evening at a club social event at Tied House, I got feedback some of
the members there. One suggestion that I should have have brought the entire
device in to show off how coffee was actually made in it. It was a bit weird
just having the bottom piece of the device. Through the feedback in the notes, I
was told that the ending could have been more impactful with more of a message.

With all of this feedback in my hands, I sat on it for a few months. When I came
back to it again, I rewrote the speech in some signficant changes.

- I decided to write and memorize my opening and conclusions. There were the
  weakest points of my speech (in my opinion).
- I made sure to actually bring my AeroPress to the next speech. It was weird
  that I didn't bring it in when I thought about it. I planned the demonstration
  as the point where I would try to address feedback about eye contact
  deliberately.
- I practiced. A lot more than I did the first time around. When I watched my
  second speech, I looked a lot more rehearsed. I remember recording myself
  quite a bit this time through.

These two speeches, though only a few months apart, feel leagues apart in terms
of the quality of the speech. I think the feedback significantly influenced how
I approached the speech this time around. The practice also smoothed the
delivery. And, though not in my control, the camera angle was a bit better. It's
actually very difficult for me to sit through the first rendition of the speech,
but much easier to watch the second one several times over.

I attribute my improvement to great feedback from the entire club, and the
process of going back and improving of the speech that I gave. With every speech
comes some new aspect that you can improve on.
