The Toastmaster of the day is the master of ceremonies (MC or emcee) and the
Toastmasters club's titular role. It may seem intimidating at first, but it's
not as bad as you would think. A Toastmaster is responsible for several things.

- Ensuring that members confirm their roles for next week's meeting.
- Creating and setting the agenda.
- Being the host for the meeting and introducing speakers to the audience.

At Mountain View Toastmasters, they also set the theme's meeting and the tip of
the day, which are ways of spicing up the meeting. The [instructions for the
club][instructions] are excellent, covering all aspects an aspiring (or
volunteered) member needs to know about the process.

The confirmation emails are probably the most labor-intensive part of the
meeting. In an email thread, usually 4-5 days before the meeting starts,
everyone is asked to confirm their roles. The most stressful part of this
process is when a role still needs to be filled, or worse, someone drops out at
the last minute. An email to the club's mailing list can get this in order,
where more experienced members often volunteer to fill void. Once roles have
been confirmed and the relevant information gathered, it's time to prepare the
agenda before sending a reminder to the club with meeting details.

It helps to practice a little for the day (but you can get away with winging
most of it ðŸ¤«). Here's what I used to prepare for my most recent meeting as
Toastmaster of the day.

#### Theme of the Day: President's Day

#### Introduction

Welcome to today's meeting. The theme of today's meeting is president's day. I
hope you enjoyed your day -- banks closed, mailboxes empty, and countless car
promotions are happening across dealerships countrywide. Here's to honoring the
legacy of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

#### Tip of the Day

We often attribute presidents to be omnipotent, all-powerful beings, but they're
people just like you and me. Use these days of remembrance to read up on the history
-- the first paragraph of Wikipedia is generally full of interesting facts.

The meeting goes by much quicker than you would expect. The first 3-5 minutes
are dedicated to welcome the club and outline the meeting for guests. The rest
of the meeting is transitioning between speakers. The Toastmaster fills in the
odd gaps on the stage and ensures that someone always attends the podium (in the
abstract now that everything is online). It's odd how often I look at my watch
or the clock during meetings; there's pressure to be timely and ensure that
meetings run to a high standard. Everyone does their part to make the
meeting a success, so it ends up being a role that actually doesn't require much
effort once the gears start turning.

Being comfortable with running a meeting is applicable to professional settings.
A fixed schedule, awareness of time, and some preparedness makes a meeting run
smoothly. Some of the details are different in-person versus online, but the
overall experience and stresses are similar. Taking on the Toastmaster role is
an excellent experience to exercise some soft skills and help out with the club;
volunteer if you have the opportunity.
