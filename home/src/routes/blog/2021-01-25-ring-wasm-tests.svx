I was recently digging into compiling a rust crate that relies on
[ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) into wasm. It is a small cryptography
library with over [7 million](https://crates.io/crates/ring) downloads to date.
While I could compile the code successfully, I ran into some errors that I
reproduced [in this PR](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/1176). First I
added a few wasm-bindgen tests by adding the appropriate feature flags. Then I
ran the tests to get the same errors I was seeing in my own rollup project.

```bash
% wasm-pack test --firefox --headless --  --test ed25519_tests

To get a better understanding of what the missing imports are, we can take a
look at the the textual representation of the generated wasm bytcode (better
known as wat). Here we use the [wasm2wat](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
utility provided by wabt.

```bash
% wasm2wat target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/deps/ed25519_tests-af557e71142febbd.wasm | grep '(import "env"'
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_ge_scalarmult_base" (func $GFp_x25519_ge_scalarmult_base (type 5)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_sc_muladd" (func $GFp_x25519_sc_muladd (type 4)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_sc_reduce" (func $GFp_x25519_sc_reduce (type 3)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_sc_mask" (func $GFp_x25519_sc_mask (type 3)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_fe_neg" (func $GFp_x25519_fe_neg (type 3)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_ge_frombytes_vartime" (func $GFp_x25519_ge_frombytes_vartime (type 11)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_fe_invert" (func $GFp_x25519_fe_invert (type 5)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_fe_mul_ttt" (func $GFp_x25519_fe_mul_ttt (type 6)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_fe_tobytes" (func $GFp_x25519_fe_tobytes (type 5)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_fe_isnegative" (func $GFp_x25519_fe_isnegative (type 18)))
  (import "env" "GFp_x25519_ge_double_scalarmult_vartime" (func $GFp_x25519_ge_double_scalarmult_vartime (type 4)))
  (import "env" "LIMBS_less_than" (func $LIMBS_less_than (type 12)))
  (import "env" "LIMBS_are_zero" (func $LIMBS_are_zero (type 11)))
```

These look like they're missing because the relevant C code is not being built.
I changed a line in the build file and added a flag that enables the wasm32
target.

```bash
 % wasm-pack test --firefox --headless --  --features wasm32_c --test ed25519_tests

```

With this, the tests pass for this particular modules. Unfortunately, this
doesn't work for other failing tests in the repository because they rely on
generated assembly code instead of C. I hear there are side-channel concerns of
using cryptography compiled to wasm too, but I'm not too familiar with the
details. Regardless, it's promising to see the progress of wasm as a target for
compiled languages like rust.
