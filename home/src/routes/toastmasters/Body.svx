# Toastmasters

I'm a member of [Mountain View Toastmasters][mvtm], a club that has helped me
become a more confident public speaker. I have been working through a series of
projects on [my Innovative Planning Pathway][pathway]. Come [join us on
Zoom][meetup] during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Blog Posts

I wrote a series of blog posts during February 2021 about my Toastmasters
experience, from speech writing to roles for a project titled "Write a
Compelling Blog ." I continue to write about Toastmasters occasionally.
