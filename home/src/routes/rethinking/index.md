# Notes on Statistical Rethinking

I'm working through the 2022 edition of [Statistical Rethinking problem sets][problem sets]. I'll be taking a Bayesian statistics class in the fall of 2022, so I'd like to get some practice early. My goal is to build intuition behind essential statistical tools and get some experience with PyMC.
