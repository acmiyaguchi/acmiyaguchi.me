# Here be dragons

Things to do, things to write.

Now halfway through the Covid-19 pandemic, I've been using the time stolen away
from productive hobbies like [Brazilian jiu-jitsu][bjj] into incredibly [grindy
MMORPGs][mmorpg] and small programming projects.

I also write open-source software for Mozilla as a Data Engineer.

You may be interested in my [blog](https://blog.acmiyaguchi.me) or [github
profile](https://github.com/acmiyaguchi)
