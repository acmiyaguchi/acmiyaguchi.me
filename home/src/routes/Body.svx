_Things to do, things to write. This is Anthony Miyaguchi's personal site._

Now halfway through the [COVID-19 pandemic][pandemic], I've been using the time stolen away
from productive hobbies like [Brazilian jiu-jitsu][bjj] into incredibly [grindy
MMORPGs][mmorpg] and small programming projects.

I also write open-source software for Mozilla as a Data Engineer. You may be
interested in my [github profile](https://github.com/acmiyaguchi).
