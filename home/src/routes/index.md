# Here be dragons üêâ

_Things to do, things to write. This is Anthony Miyaguchi's personal site._

Now more than halfway through the [COVID-19 pandemic][pandemic], I've been using
the time stolen away from productive hobbies like [Brazilian jiu-jitsu][bjj]
into incredibly [grindy MMORPGs][mmorpg] and small programming projects.

I write software for [Planet] on the storage and jobs system supporting
satellite data pipelines. I previously wrote open-source software for Mozilla as
a Data Engineer. I recently started a Masters in Computer Science at Georgia
Tech at the start of 2022. You may be interested in my [github
profile](https://github.com/acmiyaguchi).
